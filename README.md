# chess
### This game was developed in under 12 hours for a quick local game jam.
### the code might not be clean, but It was developed with one goal in mind, never google a single thing 
(why? simply maybe one day I have encountered a situation where there isn't much info online, unlikely, but still a good experience)


## Dependencies
#### you need SDL2 and SDL2image and SDL2ttf to be installed in your path so CMake can find it 
(or you can find their source and add them as a sub-directories)


### TODO
implement En passant
